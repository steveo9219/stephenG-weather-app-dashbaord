##ive had problems in the past with github pages flow, please reference the screenshot link to see if it matches up with what appears on the GH pages link.

I had a big problem trying to get github to add all my files after i didnt follow github page flow and tried to move some folders and files aaround the first time. i tried
for a while with no avail. i ended up not using my first repo and having to make another repo with the files. that worked fine.
this is my old repo that i could never get to add the updated files after moving things around and it does NOT display my site correctly.

this was a learning experience. i need to do a git status after adding any files up for commit to see if they actually will be changed in the commit or now.

For this project, we were instructed to create a Weather Dashboard.
I used the open weather API. Using this API caused some challenges that were overcome by targeting the objects correctly and converting the Kelvin temperature units to Fahrenheit. When you type in the city you are given current weather information for the day and also a 5-day forecast for the next 5 days. When looking at the UV index you will get the color based on the number value of the UV index. I saved the typed city to local storage so the customer can see what was chosen beforehand.
